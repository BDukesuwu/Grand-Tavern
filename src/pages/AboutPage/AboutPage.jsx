      <h2>Connecting people with the freshest meals</h2>
      <p>Organizer, Brianna Dukes, opened the first Grand Tavern Restaurant in Toronto, Canada on September 27, 1977. She wasn't even born yet lol. The restauraunt started on the back of a farm where all ingredients were gathered and prepared fresh.
      Today, that restaurant has grown immensely, people book reservations waiting an entire year just to have a taste.
      The Grand Tavern Restaurants are well known with a substantial gathering of people including families, kids, seniors, and business experts.
      Open day by day for lunch and dinner, The Grand Tavern offers a choice of natural, 100% grass fed steak. Top picks incorporate Certified Angus Beef®, Filet Minion®, and Wagyu® and more.
      New prepared strength plates of mixed greens, delectable mashed or baked potatos, and more.
